The SmartCampus project is an initiative of the I3S Laboratory to build a scalable software architecture taming the data collection from the remote sensor networks.


Developed at the Sophia Tech campus, the idea behind this project is to imagine a **living lab** where every building would be equipped with **sensors** producing **data** available for every user in the campus (*opendata approach*). These data can be processed by users to build **new services**.

Users polls and discussions allowed to highlight the 3 following scenarios:

* S1. Parking lot occupation
* S2. Availability and temperature of class rooms
* S3. Waiting queue at the cafeteria

This list is not exhaustive but reflects the user's idea of what should provide a **Smart Campus**

With the assumption that a sensor can generate up to *3 Gb* of data per year, deploying the *(S1)* and *(S2)* scenarios could produce respectively up to 1.5 Tb (500 parking spaces) and 300 Gb (100 class rooms) data.

Storing and parsing such an amount of data is not, at first sight, an easy task for every developers.

Therefore, the SmartCampus goal is to design an architecture able to **collect** data from remote sensor networks, to **store** them and to give **access** to them in a **efficient** way.


## Facts and figures

The *SmartCampus* project has been defined within a final year project at Polytech Nice-Sophia - Engineering School by a group of 4 people.

A first prototype of the *SmartCampus* project has been deployed (Summer 2014) at the I3S Laboratory - Templiers Building (UMR7271 - UNS CNRS).

*A twenty people* have been working, directly or not, with the SmartCampus project for their reseach needs.

*2 scientific publications* linked with SmartCampus.

## Research interests

All the projects represented in the I3S Laboratory - Templiers Building have expressed interest in the SmartCampus project to obtain data related to their reseach interests.

* Rainbow project: Sensor Data visualization, ambiant computing, security and privacy around datasets
* Modalis project: Large scale sensing infrastructures, application composition on sensing infrastructure
* Wimmics project: Semantics on sensor data
* MinD project: Data mining, maching learning training sets

Lots of reseach fields can use the SmartCampus project to obtain data reflecting a **real** exploitation of an University Campus.
