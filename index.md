## A glimpse on the Project

SmartCampus project aims to equip the SophiaTech campus (Sophia Antipolis, France)
with sensors collecting data about campus usage. 

The goal of this project is to consider sensors deployed in buildings as an open platform to let final users (i.e., students, professors, administrative staff) build their own innovative services on top of the collected (open) data.
The SmartCampus project started in September 2013, and involves a team of 18 persons. 

## Who is behind ?

SmartCampus project is an initiative of the I3S laboratory and the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis. It is currently being financed by the I3S laboratory.

## A growing Project

In less than one year of existence, three papers have been accepted and a cross platform prototype is already installed in the laboratory.
The project is now ready for step up to another level.
